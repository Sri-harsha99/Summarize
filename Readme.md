# Summarize - a Google workspace add-on

This project aims to develop an add-on for gmail that could do the following things.


*   Send a summary of the important mails you have recieved at the end of day.
*   Send an AI generated mail as a reply to specified users.

I'm using Python and GCP services develop the application. To generate the summary and AI generated mail, I'm using Cohere API.
